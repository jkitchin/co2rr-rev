# Nuisances
## Obsidian

1. Uses spaces in pasted figures that don't render on GH
2. Non-standard syntax for links that don't render on GH

## logseq

1. Adds - to documents for some reason
2. unclear what the citation/zotero integration is. First attempt to use it could not find the bib file.

## Emacs

1. nonstandard markdown links are not supported, can't follow them.
2. No image support
3. Need to integrate org-ref to facilitate citations


## Vim/VS Code and other tools

Probably the same as emacs, but no chance for org-ref to work. 

## Markdown

It's not org-mode.
