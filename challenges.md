# Challenges

## PDFs and where are they?

We need to access these to read them, annotate them, etc. but we are not allowed to store them in a public repo. It is not possible to grant permission to folders within a git repo, so either the whole repo is private, or the PDFs go in another repo.

## Eventually what?

Would we aim towards something publishable? We can always get a DOI via Zenodo/Figshare. Maybe there is something like https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/catalog/category/reviews where this could live. Should this eventually be public? Or something that could sold? e.g. to companies? It depends highly on the quality of the topical documents that get written. They need to be just useful enough for us.
