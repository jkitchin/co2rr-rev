Workflow tools
=======================

These will be a set of scripts that automate as many things as can be done. For example, you might run a script (probably a Python script) that pulls new articles from the last month down, and converts them to a data file for review.

Then, you might run another command that presents the articles to you in a way that facilitates making decisions about where they go (e.g. discard or next step).

When you are done for the time being, you would run a command that checks in your work, and synchronizes it with the team repo.
