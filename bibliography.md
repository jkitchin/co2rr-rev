Bibliography database
=================================

Probably we will use Bibtex. Bibtex is a standard plain text format, can be imported into most other bibliography tools, and there are tools for analyzing, and modifying the database that will be useful later. 

For an example bibtex file see [co2rr.bib](co2rr.bib).
